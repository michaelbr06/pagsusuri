I am the Lord thy God. Thou shall not have strange gods before Me.
Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
Remember to keep holy the Lord's day.
Honor thy father and mother.
Thou shall not kill.
Thou shall not commit adultery.
Thou shall not steal.
Thou shall not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife.
Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's goods.
